                <h2>Why Choose ZenMarket</h2>
                <p>Buying from a Japanese online shop is no easy task for those who don't live in Japan and don’t speak
                    the language. Without knowing Japanese, it’s tricky to go through a registration process on a common
                    Japanese website, or to communicate with a seller. Moreover, many Japanese online marketplaces don’t
                    accept foreign credit cards and some will only accept local bank transfers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="reason-card">
                <img class="reasons-icon" src="./img/reasons-cart.svg" alt="ZenMarket your one shopping cart">
                <h2>Your One Shopping Cart</h2>
                <p>In Japanese online shops or auctions you can find goods which are available only in Japan: Japanese
                    anime figures, Japanese fishing goods, Japanese antiques, watches, Japanese traditional goods,
                    Japanese sweets and many other items unique to Japan. We are sure you will find something for you in
                    Japanese online marketplaces and auctions.</p>

                <img class="reasons-icon" src="./img/reasons-how.svg" alt="How does ZenMarket work">
                <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
                <p>You can purchase from any Japanese online shop or auction. Just add the item URL link to your Cart
                    and place the order. Our staff will check the items requested and confirm with you quickly. You can
                    buy from many different online stores and we will consolidate all the items for you into one single
                    parcel with better packaging, saving you money and time.</p>
